I read 24 Bar on my manifold. The starter contacts weren't firm.  I
couldn't measure peak current (yet). Initially, it was rather hard for
me to see the world in psi. Bars are easiler. 3/8 was equally
tough. The caliper said it all. I spent my time today just measuring
known quantities. Language - measurements. Beautiful.
